**Focus of the Paper:**
- The paper introduces a novel approach to comprehending users' interactions with visualizations.
- Previous studies have largely categorized tasks as either basic or complex, neglecting intermediary steps.
- Authors propose a new system for classifying tasks into distinct levels, elucidating their purposes, methodologies, and outcomes.
- This system facilitates the depiction of intricate tasks as sequences of simpler ones, enhancing comprehension and comparison of various visualization methods.

**Typology Structure:**
   - Explores users' motivations for engaging with data visualizations.
   - Encompasses overarching objectives such as exploration, presentation, or hypothesis validation.
   - Defines the nature of data or specific data aspects under user focus.
   - Includes aspects like identifying trends, distributions, or relationships within the data.
    - Focuses on the techniques and methodologies employed in task execution.
   - Encompasses actions like selection, navigation, arrangement, and modification of visualizations.

**Purpose:**
- Aims to enhance designers' comprehension of requisite tasks across diverse visualization domains.
- Ultimately aims to improve the quality and efficacy of visualizations through better task understanding and design implementation.
