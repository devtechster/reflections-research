  - Considers costs like development, user training, and usage expenses, along with benefits like gained knowledge.
- **Key Points from the Model**:
  - Differentiates between costs (Ci, Cu, Cs, Ce) and gains (G) to understand the overall value.
  - Discusses how visualization can be subjective, initial user costs can be high, and interaction plays a crucial role.
- **Conclusion**:
  - Emphasizes the importance of proving the effectiveness, efficiency, and real-world adoption of visualization by carefully weighing costs against benefits.
  - Suggests an alternative view of visualization as an art form, highlighting its value through creativity, attractiveness, and the intellectual satisfaction of crafting innovative solutions.
