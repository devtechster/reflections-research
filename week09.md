([Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10292909)).
- Explored how data visualization is perceived by individuals outside the field/general public.
- Study involved 19 participants from diverse backgrounds.
- Identified 4 types of receptivity patterns: 'Information-Avoidant', 'Data-Cautious', 'Data-Enthusiastic', and 'Domain-Grounded'.
- Emphasized the importance of considering these varied responses in creating informative visualizations for the general public.
- Highlighted the necessity for 'information receptivity' due to differences in how people prefer to receive information.
- Acknowledged the challenge for data experts in creating visuals that appeal to all preferences.
- Stressed the need for researchers to understand the reasons behind these preferences and how they evolve.
- Proposed future research to explore different topics and more diverse groups to create universally understandable visuals and open data systems.
