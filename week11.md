  - **Title**: "How Data Analysts Use a Visualization Grammar in Practice" by Xiaoying Pu and Matthew Kay[link] ("https://mucollective.northwestern.edu/files/2023-vis-grammar-in-practice.pdf").

- **Paper Analysis**:
  - Investigated how analysts use visualization grammars like ggplot2 in R or the Vega ecosystem in JavaScript during their analyses.
  - Aimed to enhance these grammars to better meet analysts' needs.
- **Research Method**:
  - Studied six experienced analysts from TidyTuesday.
  - Analysts used R's ggplot for their analyses.
  - Recorded analysts' visualization creation process before and after being informed about the study.
  - Conducted interviews and analyzed recordings to understand analysts' approaches.
- **Findings**:
  - Analysts tailored their use of visualization components based on analytical tasks and customization needs.
  - Encountered challenges like silent errors or difficult-to-debug errors despite specifying valid plots.
  - Identified iterative patterns in their analysis processes.
  - Generalized findings to other visualization grammars like Vega.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Make grammars more user-friendly and consistent with data wrangling specifications.
  - Emphasize customizability and provide comprehensive documentation.
  - Advocate for the use of interactive notebooks to enhance visualization development beyond coding.
