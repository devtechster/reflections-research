- **Discussion Overview**:
  - Traditional static line graphs have limitations, especially with small or overlapping datasets.
  - Line graphs are prevalent, appearing in 61% of papers, making them the second most common figure type for continuous data presentation.
- **Objective**:
  - Transitioning to interactive line graphs for better data comprehension.
  - Interactive features enable users to explore various aspects and layers of the dataset, such as individual data points and changes across different conditions or time points.
- **Benefits of Interactivity**:
  - Enhances transparency and understanding of data.
  - Offers a more detailed and dynamic perspective.
  - Reduces misinterpretation risks associated with static graphs.
- **Promotion of Hands-On Data Analysis**:
  - Encourages deeper exploration of specifics.
  - Fosters a culture of transparency and critical evaluation in research.
